# valdore86-recipes

AutoPkg recipes (https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg) to be used for adding packages to Munki.

#### KeePassX
The KeePassX recipe uses GPGSignatureVerifier, which is an external SharedProcessor from  
-> https://github.com/autopkg/gerardkok-recipes


#### Things
For Things there are two recipes. One for Things 2 and one for the latest.  
Since upgrading to Things 3 is a paid upgrade, I don't want to push an update from 2 to 3.
